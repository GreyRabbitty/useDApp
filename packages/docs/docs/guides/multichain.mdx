# Using multichain

## Prerequisites

The tutorial assumes the user has already started with the basics of `useDApp`.

See the [Getting Started](../getting-started.mdx) guide if you are a new user.

## Motivation

The most common approach for a DApp is to operate on a single chain. But there are some use cases when one would want to display data from multiple chains simultaneously. 

`useDApp` has built-in multichain support.

In this tutorial we will create a simple DApp that will display simultaneously balance of an address both on Mainnet and om Kovan.

## Add Kovan network to the config

As a first step we need to add the Kovan network configuration. As Kovan is a network supported by default in `useDApp`, the only thing we have to do is to specify an endpoint where requests can be sent to. In our case we will use Infura - free Etherum API, that also supports the Kovan testnet. 
Please make the following changes to the app's entrypoint file. 
````diff
  import {
    Mainnet,
+   Kovan,
    DAppProvider,
    useEtherBalance,
    useEthers,
    Config
  } from '@usedapp/core'
  import { formatEther } from '@ethersproject/units'

  import App from 'App'

  const config: Config = {
    readOnlyChainId: Mainnet.chainId,
    readOnlyUrls: {
      [Mainnet.chainId]: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/62687d1a985d4508b2b7a24827551934',
+     [Kovan.chainId]: 'https://kovan.infura.io/v3/62687d1a985d4508b2b7a24827551934',
    },
  }

  ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <DAppProvider config={config}>
        <App />
      </DAppProvider>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root')
  )
````

## Display balances on Mainnet and on Kovan

Our app will be based on one described in the [Getting Started](../getting-started.mdx) guide.

Populate the `App.tsx` file with the following code.

import { ExampleContainer } from '../../src/examples/ExampleContainer';
import Multichain from '../../example-loader.js!../../src/examples/Multichain.tsx'

<ExampleContainer example={Multichain}/>

This will take the `0x2A734Da1E0B14dC63E7dE96073329720FF50ACaC` address and display the ether balance of it on both chains.

Now after running the app, you should see the balances on both chains.

## Summary

In this tutorial we created a simple DApp that displays the balance of an address on two chains. This demonstrates how to display data from different chains using `useDApp`.
