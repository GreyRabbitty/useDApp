## ChainId

A number describing the ID of the chain. See [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/) for a list of known chains and their IDs.
The list of built-in chain IDs in useDapp can be found [here](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/useDApp/blob/master/packages/core/src/constants/chainId.ts).

## Call

Represents a single call to a contract that can be included in multicall.

Fields:

- ``contract: Contract`` - contract instance, see [Contract](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract/)

- ``method: string`` - function name

- ``args: any[]`` - arguments for the function

Typechecking:

If you want a variable of type Call to be type checked you need to pass a typechain contract type as in below example

```tsx
  const typedCall: Call<ERC20> = {contract:ERC20Contract,method:'name',args:[]}
```

If you also supply a method name in type arguments will also be type checked

```tsx
  const typedCall: Call<ERC20,'name'> = {contract:ERC20Contract,method:'name',args:[]}
```

## CallResult

Result of a [useCall](./02-Hooks.mdx#usecall) query.

It is `undefined` when call didn't return yet or a object `{ value, error }` if it did.

- `value:` `any[] | undefined` - array of results or undefined if error occurred,
- `error`: `Error | undefined` - encountered error or undefined if call was successful.

## RawCall

Represents a single call on the blockchain that can be included in multicall.

Fields:

- ``address: string`` - address of a contract to call

- ``data: string`` - calldata of the call that encodes function call

- ``chainId: number`` - chain id of the chain to perform the call on

## RawCallResult

Result of a [useRawCall](./02-Hooks.mdx#userawcall) query.

It is `undefined` when call didn't return yet or object `{ success: boolean, value: string }` if it did.

- `success` - boolean indicating whether call was successful or not,
- `value` - encoded result when success is `true` or encoded error message when success is `false`.

## LogsResult

Result of a [useLogs](./02-Hooks.mdx#uselogs) query.

It is `undefined` when the query didn't return yet or one of the following objects:

- `{ value: DetailedEventRecord[], error: undefined }`, if the query succeeded,
- `{ value: undefined, error: Error }`, if the query failed.

Type `DetailedEventRecord` represents a single event (log) on a typed contract:

```typescript
type DetailedEventRecord<T extends TypedContract, EN extends ContractEventNames<T>> = {
  data: EventRecord<T, EN>,
  blockNumber: number,
  blockHash: string,
  transactionIndex: number,
  transactionHash: string,
  removed: boolean,
}
```

Additional resources related to events can be found [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#events).

## ChainCall

Represents a single call on the blockchain that can be included in multicall.

Fields:

- ``address: string`` - address of a contract to call

- ``data: string`` - calldata of the call that encodes function call

## ContractCall

Represents a single call to a contract that can be included in multicall.

## Currency

The ``Currency`` class is tasked with representing the individual currencies as well as handling formatting.

The base ``Currency`` class is constructed with the following parameters:

- ``name`` - name of the currency
- ``ticker`` - e.g. USD, EUR, BTC
- ``decimals`` - number of decimal places (e.g. 2 for USD, 18 for ETH)
- ``formattingOptions`` - define how the currency values are formatted

The following formatting options are supported:

- ``decimals`` - Defaults to the decimals of the currency.
- ``thousandSeparator`` - Defaults to ``','``. Used for separating thousands.
- ``decimalSeparator`` - Defaults to ``'.'``. Used for separating the integer part from the decimal part.
- ``significantDigits`` - Defaults to Infinity. Can limit the number of digits on the decimal part, such that either the total number of displayed digits is equal to this parameter or more digits are displayed, but the decimal part is missing.
- ``useFixedPrecision`` - Defaults to false. Switches from using significant digits to fixed precision digits.
- ``fixedPrecisionDigits`` - Defaults to 0. Can specify the number of digits on the decimal part.
- ``prefix`` - Defaults to ``''``. Prepended to the result.
- ``suffix`` - Defaults to ``''``. Appended to the result.

Other variants of ``Currency`` include ``FiatCurrency``, ``NativeCurrency`` and ``Token``.

``FiatCurrency`` takes the same parameters as ``Currency`` but uses fixed precision digits by default.

``NativeCurrency`` additionally takes a ``chainId`` parameter. The format function is configured with the ticker prefix and 6 significant digits by default.

``Token`` additionally takes a ``chainId`` parameter as well as an ``address`` parameter. The format function is configured with the ticker prefix and 6 significant digits by default.

## CurrencyValue

The ``CurrencyValue`` class represents a value tied to a currency. The methods include:

- ``static fromString(currency, value)`` - creates a new CurrencyValue from string.
- ``static zero(currency)`` - creates a new CurrencyValue equal to 0.
- ``toString()`` - returns the value of the CurrencyValue as a decimal string with no formatting.
- ``format(overrideOptions?)`` - formats the value according to the currency. The caller can override the formatting options.
- ``map(fn)`` - returns a new CurrencyValue with value transformed by the callback.
- ``add(other)`` - returns a new CurrencyValue with value being the sum of this value and other value. The argument must be a CurrencyValue with the same Currency.
- ``sub(other)`` - returns a new CurrencyValue with value being the difference of this value and other value. The argument must be a CurrencyValue with the same Currency.
- ``mul(value)`` - returns a new CurrencyValue with value multiplied by the argument.
- ``div(value)`` - returns a new CurrencyValue with value divided by the argument.
- ``mod(value)`` - returns a new CurrencyValue with value modulo the argument.
- ``equals(other)`` - performs an equality check on the currencies and the values of both objects.
- ``lt(other)`` - checks if this value is less than the other value. The argument must be a CurrencyValue with the same Currency.
- ``lte(other)`` - checks if this value is less than or equal to the other value. The argument must be a CurrencyValue with the same Currency.
- ``gt(other)`` - checks if this value is greater than the other value. The argument must be a CurrencyValue with the same Currency.
- ``gte(other)`` - checks if this value is greater than or equal to the other value. The argument must be a CurrencyValue with the same Currency.
- ``isZero()`` - returns true if the value is zero.

## TokenInfo

Represents general token information.

Fields:

- ``name: string`` - token name or an empty string.

- ``symbol: string`` - token symbol or an empty string.

- ``decimals?: numbers`` - optional field that contains token decimals.

- ``totalSupply?: BigNumberish`` - optional field that contains total supply of the token.

## TransactionOptions

Represents a options for sending transactions.
All fields are optional.

Fields:

- ``signer?: Signer`` - specifies [signer](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer) for a transaction.

- ``transactionName?: string`` - specifies a transaction name. Used by notifications and history hooks.

## TransactionStatus

Represents a state of a single transaction.

Fields:

- ``status: TransactionState`` - string that can contain one of ``None`` ``PendingSignature`` ``Mining`` ``Success`` ``Fail`` ``Exception``

- ``transaction?: TransactionResponse`` - optional field. See [Transaction Response](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/types/#providers-TransactionResponse).

- ``originalTransaction?: TransactionResponse`` - optional field that contains the original transaction if it has been dropped and replaced. See [Transaction Response](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/types/#providers-TransactionResponse).

- ``receipt?: TransactionReceipt`` - optional field. See [Transaction Receipt](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/types/#providers-TransactionReceipt).

- ``chainId?: ChainId`` - optional field. See [ChainID](#chainid).

- ``errorMessage?: string`` - optional field that contains error message when transaction fails or throws.

``status`` can be one of the following:

- **None** - before a transaction is created.
- **PendingSignature** - when a transaction has been initiated, but requires signature.
- **Mining** - when a transaction is sent to the network, but not yet mined. In this state ``transaction: TransactionResponse`` is available.
- **Success** - when a transaction has been mined successfully. In this state ``transaction: TransactionResponse`` and ``receipt: TransactionReceipt`` are available.
- **Fail** - when a transaction has been mined, but ended up reverted. Again ``transaction: TransactionResponse`` and ``receipt: TransactionReceipt`` are available.
- **Exception** - when a transaction hasn't started, due to the exception that was thrown before the transaction was propagated to the network. The exception can come from application/library code (e.g. unexpected exception like malformed arguments) or externally (e.g user discarded transaction in Metamask). In this state the ``errorMessage: string`` is available (as well as exception object).

Additionally all states except ``None``, contain ``chainId: ChainId``.

Change in ``state`` will update the component so you can use it in useEffect.

## TypedFilter

Represents a filter of logs emitted on a typed contract.

**Example**

```typescript
const filter: TypedFilter = {
  contract: token,
  event: 'Transfer',
  args: [null, deployer.address],
}
```

To be used with the [useLogs](./02-Hooks.mdx#uselogs) hook.

## QueryParams

Optional overrides for hooks querying the state of the blockchain.

An object consisting of:

- ``chainId?: ChainId`` - ChainId of the chain you want to perform the query on. Defaults to the chainId of the connected wallet. See [ChainID](#chainid).
- ``isStatic?: boolean`` - Whether the query is static (not expected to change between calls). Used for optimizations.

## LogQueryParams

Extends the [QueryParams](#queryparams) object with parameters related to querying logs (blockchain events).

Adds fields:

- `fromBlock?: BlockTag` - The starting block (inclusive) to search for logs matching the filter criteria.
- `toBlock?: BlockTag` - The end block (inclusive) to search for logs matching the filter criteria.
- `blockHash?: string` - The specific block (by its block hash) to search for logs matching the filter criteria.
