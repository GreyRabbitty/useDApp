# Writing

To write a state-changing transaction to the blockchain, use the [useSendTransaction](/docs/API%20Reference/Hooks#usesendtransaction) hook.

Simply call a hook in a component:

```tsx
  const { sendTransaction } = useSendTransaction()
```

Typically you would use the `sendTransaction` in a click button handler:

```tsx
  const handleClick = () => {
    setDisabled(true)
    sendTransaction({ to: address, value: utils.parseEther(amount) })
  }
```

See the [Ether Transactions](/docs/Guides/Transactions/Ether%20Transactions) guide for a more in-depth explanation, or take a look at [Contract Functions](/docs/Guides/Transactions/Contract%20Functions) if you are interested in writing transactions to contracts.
