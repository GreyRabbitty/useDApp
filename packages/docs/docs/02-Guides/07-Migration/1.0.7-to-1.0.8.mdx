# Migrating to 1.0.8

## Moved ethers to peer dependencies

`ethers` is now a peer dependency of `@usedapp/core`, `@usedapp/coingecko` and `@usedapp/siwe`. The packages will use version of the `ethers` package that is installed in your project. If you haven't installed `ethers` yet, you can install it with:
```bash npm2yarn
npm install ethers
```
