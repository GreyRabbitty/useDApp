# Migrating to 1.0.4

## Updated useLookupAddress hook

`useLookupAddress` hook now takes an argument and returns object instead of string.
The argument is of type `string | undefined` and is the address to be looked up.
The return object consists of three values:
- `ens: string | null | undefined` - ENS name of the account.
- `isLoading: boolean` - indicates whether the lookup is in progress.
- `error: Error | null` - error that occurred during the lookup or null if no error occurred.

To preserve behaviour of the hook, update your code in the following manner:
````diff
  - const ens = useLookupAddress()
  + const { account } = useEthers()
  + const { ens } = useLookupAddress(account)
````

## Added useResolveName hook

`useResolveName` hook is used to resolve an ENS name to a specific address. You can check out the docs on the hook [here](../../API%20Reference/Hooks#useresolvename).
