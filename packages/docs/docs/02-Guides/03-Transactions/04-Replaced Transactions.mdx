# Replaced Transactions

If the status is pending you can replace a transaction with increased gas limit to have it mined quicker. To do it just send another transaction with the same nonce as the previous one. The new transaction replaces the previous one.
After replacing a transaction on a wallet, Usedapp will detect this and track the new, replaced transaction.

## UseDapp behaviour

UseDapp supports replaced transactions. It detects replacement and shows `Success` when new transaction will be mined.
