# Contract Functions

To send a transaction that executes a function of a contract on a blockchain, you can use a [useContractFunction](/docs/API%20Reference/Hooks#usecontractfunction) hook,
it works similarly to [useSendTransaction](/docs/API%20Reference/Hooks#usesendtransaction). It returns a ``send`` function that we can use to call a contract function and ``state`` object.

To use ``useContractFunction`` we need to supply it with a Contract of type [Contract](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract/).
And a string ``functionName``.

``send`` function maps arguments 1 to 1 with functions of a contract and also accepts one additional argument of type [TransactionOverrides](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract/#contract-functionsSend).

## Example

Start by declaring a contract variable with address of contract you want to call and ABI interface of a contract.

```tsx
  import { utils } from 'ethers'
  import { Contract } from '@ethersproject/contracts'

  ...

  const wethInterface = new utils.Interface(WethAbi)
  const wethContractAddress = '0xA243FEB70BaCF6cD77431269e68135cf470051b4'
  const contract = new Contract(wethContractAddress, wethInterface)
```

After that you can use the hook to create ``send`` function and ``state`` object.

```tsx
  const { state, send } = useContractFunction(contract, 'deposit', { transactionName: 'Wrap' })

  const depositEther = (etherAmount: string) => {
    send({ value: utils.parseEther(etherAmount) })
  }
```

```tsx
  const { state, send } = useContractFunction(contract, 'withdraw', { transactionName: 'Unwrap' })

  const withdrawEther = (wethAmount: string) => {
    send(utils.parseEther(wethAmount))
  }
```

The code snippets above will wrap and unwrap Ether into WETH using Wrapped Ether [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#code) respectively.
Deposit function of a contract has no input arguments and instead wraps amount of ether sent to it. To send given amount of ether simply use a ``TransactionOverrides`` object.
Withdraw function needs amount of ether to withdraw as a input argument.

**Live example**

App will deposit 1 wei to Wrapped Ether contract.
Connect a MetaMask wallet **and switch to a test network**, such as Kovan or Ropsten.
