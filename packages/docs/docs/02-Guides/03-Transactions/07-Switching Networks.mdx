# Switching networks

When building a dApp that works across multiple chains you might want to send a transaction on one chain while the user has a different chain selected in their wallet.

You could prompt the user to switch a network using the `switchNetwork` function:

```typescript
const { switchNetwork, chainId } = useEthers()

const sendTransaction = async () => {
  if(chainId !== Mainnet.chainId) {
    await switchNetwork(Mainnet.chainId)
  }

  // ...send a transaction on mainnet
}
```

If the user has metamask installed they would see the following prompt:

![switch-network](../../images/metamask-switch-network.png)

## Example

import { ExampleContainer } from '/src/examples/ExampleContainer';
import SwitchingNetworks from '../../../example-loader.js!/src/examples/SwitchingNetworks.tsx'

<ExampleContainer example={SwitchingNetworks}/>
