/**
 * Represents current state of a transaction.
 *
 * Can be one of the following:
 * - `None` - before a transaction is created.
 * - `Pending signature` - when a transaction has been initiated, but requires signature.
 * - `Mining` - when a transaction is sent to the network, but not yet mined. In this state `transaction: TransactionResponse` is available.
 * - `Success` - when a transaction has been mined successfully. In this state `transaction: TransactionResponse` and `receipt: TransactionReceipt` are available.
 * - `Fail` - when a transaction has been mined, but ended up reverted. Again `transaction: TransactionResponse` and `receipt: TransactionReceipt` are available.
 * - `Exception` - when a transaction hasn't started, due to the exception that was thrown before the transaction was propagated to the network. The exception can come from application/library code (e.g. unexpected exception like malformed arguments) or externally (e.g user discarded transaction in Metamask). In this state the `errorMessage: string` is available (as well as exception object).
 * - `CollectingSignaturePool` - when user is sending transaction by Multisig wallet (Gnosis Safe) and is waiting for other owners to sign the transaction.
